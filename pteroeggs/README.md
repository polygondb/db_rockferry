# Ptero Egg
Very simple to use, all you have to do is run it and it will generate all the appropriate files.

The Ptero Egg automatically installs all the needed and up-to-date files necessarily. If the code ever gets old or out-of-date then all you gotta do is reinstall the server.

Server Minimum Requirements:

* 5% CPU (Uses very little CPU power)
* 16MB Memory (32MB if it gets used a lot)
* 64MB Storage (Matters on Database Size)
* 1 Additional Port (Allows users to access the database)

**Sidenote:** It's worth to note that the server will use very litle resources.
